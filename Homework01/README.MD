# Deliverable 3 
### What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
    When completing this assignment i did encounter some challenges. The main
    challenge I faced was learning how to use pytest. I knew how to code the 
    answer to the problem right away however I did not know how to write the
    tests. I went through and did research from the lecture and from online 
    resources to see how the library worked. Once I leared I wrote a simpler 
    test to test it out. From there I took the principals and applied it to the
    assignment. Another thing I struggled with finding different values
    to test when something was both a right triangle and something else but I 
    eventually Found resources to help
     
### What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
    I think the requirements were very clear when it came to the normal python
    coding of this assignment. They gave hints, they were direct 
    and specific. I did however find that the requirements surrounding the testing 
    portion of the assignment to be very vague and not specific. 
    They left me unsure if I completed the assignment to its fullest on that end
   
### What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
    Some challenegs with the too was having trouble trying to run pytest as I had 
    installed it in the wrong folder. Once I got it installed in
    the right place it ended up working out and I was able to run it. Other than that, 
    I have used python in great amounts so I am used to the 
    language, IDE and librarires so I didnt run into issues.
   
### Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e.
### how did you know you were done?
    Since the requiremnts surronding this were vague. I decided to go through and check
    that each and every outcome the function to classify 
    the triangle was covered. I checked every possible outcome before determining I was
    done. I also ran a coverage test to see if the lines 
    in the function were covered before deciding I was finished.
