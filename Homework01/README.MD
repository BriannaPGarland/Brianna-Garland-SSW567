#What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
    When completing this assignment i did encounter some challenges. The main challenge I faced was learning how to use pytest. 
     I knew how to code the answer to the problem right away however I did not know how to write the tests. I went through and did 
     research from the lecture and from online resources to see how the library worked. Once I leared I wrote a simpler test to test
     it out. From there I took the principals and applied it to the assignment. Another thing I struggled with finding different values
     to test when something was both a right triangle and something else but I eventually Found resources to help
     
#What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
    I think the requirements were very clear when it came to the normal python coding of this assignment. They gave hints, they were direct 
   and specific. I did however find that the requirements surrounding the testing portion of the assignment to be very vague and not specific. 
   They left me unsure if I completed the assignment to its fullest on that end
   
#What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
    Some challenegs with the too was having trouble trying to run pytest as I had installed it in the wrong folder. Once I got it installed in
   the right place it ended up working out and I was able to run it. Other than that, I have used python in great amounts so I am used to the 
   language, IDE and librarires so I didnt run into issues.
   
#Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
    Since the requiremnts surronding this were vague. I decided to go through and check that each and every outcome the function to classify 
     the triangle was covered. I checked every possible outcome before determining I was done. I also ran a coverage test to see if the lines 
     in the function were covered before deciding I was finished.
